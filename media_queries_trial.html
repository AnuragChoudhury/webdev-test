                    Ferrari 812 superfast
                </h3>
                The Ferrari 812 Superfast (Type F152M) is a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive grand tourer produced by Italian sports car manufacturer Ferrari that made its debut at the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. The 812 Superfast is the successor to the F12berlinetta.
                <br>
                The 812 Superfast has a 6,496 cc (6.5 L) F140 GA V12, an enlarged version of the 6.3-litre engine used in the F12berlinetta. It generates a power output of 800 PS (588 kW; 789 hp) at 8,500 rpm and 718 N⋅m (530 lb⋅ft) of torque at 7,000 rpm.[7][8] According to Ferrari in 2018, the 812 Superfast's engine was, at the time, the most powerful naturally aspirated production car engine ever made. It does not feature turbocharging or hybrid technology. Cars built in 2019 or before were not fitted with petrol particulate filters, whereas cars built in 2020 or after are now fitted with the emissions device

                    Triumph Street Triple RS
                </h3>
                The Triumph Street Triple was launched in 2007, to replace the 600 Speed Four. It shared the design of the modern Triumph naked models, introduced on the Speed Triple in 2005, with high-level double-barrel silencers, dual circular headlights with a dashboard unit mounted on the top. The biggest difference with the Speed Triple is the conventional swingarm, instead of the single-sided unit. The cycle parts are shared with the Triumph Daytona 675, mainly visible on the frame and swingarm. The 675cc triple cylinders engine, borrowed to the Daytona 675, is de-tuned to make it more street friendly and usable as a daily rider naked, but still powerful in the category with 79 kW (106 bhp) @ 11,750 rpm. Since the Daytona 675 engine is a triple cylinders, Triumph introduced a new naming instead of adding the displacement to the Speed Triple name, making it a brand new model in Triumph history.
